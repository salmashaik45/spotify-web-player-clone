# 🎧 Spotify Web Player Clone

Music isn’t just something we hear - it’s something we experience.
What if you could not only listen to music, but build the player that plays it?

This project started as a simple Spotify UI clone, but I wanted it to feel alive.  
So I turned it into a fully interactive **frontend music player** using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 🎵 What You Can Do

- Click any song card → it starts playing instantly  
- Play / Pause toggle with icon switching  
- Album cover, title, and artist update dynamically  
- Real-time progress bar while the song plays  
- Drag to seek through the track  
- Smooth volume control with live percentage feedback  

It’s not just a layout - it behaves like a real music player.

## 💻 Frontend Focus

This is a **pure frontend project**.

No backend.  
No frameworks.  
Just core web technologies working together.

While building this, I practiced:

- DOM manipulation  
- Event handling  
- HTMLAudioElement API  
- UI state synchronization  
- Debugging layout issues  
- Clean Git workflow  
- Deployment with Netlify  

This project helped me move from building static pages to creating interactive frontend applications.
